# lung-cancer
We created an algorithm that takes an x-ray image or pdf as input and outputs a percentage indicating how certain the algorithm is that the subject has lung cancer. I trained my model with more than 5000 images and it has an accuracy of 85.67 percent. Some of the technologies We used include TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Pillow, Numpy, and Python.
